# NLP Chatbot in C - Roadmap 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a simple **NLP-based chatbot** in C, implementing fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

---

## 📅 Project Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Understanding NLP Basics**
🔹 Learn about NLP concepts such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and intent classification.

🔹 Study text representation techniques like **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF**.

🔹 Research how chatbots process and generate responses.

### **Phase 2: Setting Up the Project**
🔹 Organize project files and create a modular structure.

🔹 Implement basic **I/O functions** for chatbot interaction.

🔹 Prepare a sample **dataset of user queries and responses** (CSV or text-based).

### **Phase 3: Text Preprocessing in C**
🔹 **Tokenization** - Split user input into words.

🔹 **Stopword Removal** - Filter out common words (e.g., "is", "the", "a").

🔹 **Stemming & Lemmatization** - Reduce words to their base form.

🔹 **String Matching Algorithms** - Implement a basic regex-like pattern matcher.

### **Phase 4: Intent Classification**
🔹 Implement **Bag of Words (BoW)** or **TF-IDF** for representing text numerically.

🔹 Develop a **Naive Bayes Classifier** or **Simple Neural Network** to classify intents.

🔹 Train and test with a small dataset of categorized user queries.

### **Phase 5: Response Generation**
🔹 Implement a **rule-based response system** (decision tree, keyword matching).

🔹 Explore AI-based response generation using **Markov Models** or **basic sequence learning**.

🔹 Store predefined responses in **structured data files** (e.g., JSON, CSV, or arrays).

### **Phase 6: Building the Chat Interface**
🔹 Develop a **CLI-based chatbot** to interact with users.

🔹 Handle **real-time input processing** with efficient string parsing.

🔹 Ensure smooth user experience with error handling and feedback loops.

### **Phase 7: Training & Optimizing the Model**
🔹 Tune hyperparameters like learning rate, classification thresholds.

🔹 Test chatbot responses with multiple datasets.

🔹 Optimize **search algorithms** for better response retrieval.

### **Phase 8: Advanced Features (Optional)**
🔹 Implement **sentiment analysis** for contextual responses.

🔹 Add **multilingual support** using simple translation APIs.

🔹 Develop a **networked chatbot** (using C sockets) for web integration.
